Data repository for "What Happened" ghostwriter(s) analysis project @ UC Berkeley

# VERY IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR UC BERKELEY SUPPORT GHOSTWRITING OR SIMILAR ACADEMIC FRAUDS.

The author of this research does not represent UC Berkeley. This research should not be constructed as endorsement of ghostwriting by the author or UC Berkeley.  Please review the UC academic code of conduct for more information. 

# Background
A simple research project that aims to find the ghostwriter(s) behind "What Happened", published under the name of "Hillary Clinton". This project seeks to answer whether or not one is able to find key information about a writer based on their writing using stylometry. The scope of the project is to identify key demographic information about the ghostwriter(s): gender, age, and profession. 

As of March 2018, all of the ghostwriters of the books published under the "Hillary Clinton" name have been identified except for "What Happened". Thus, the outcome of the project will not be verifiable, until the ghostwriter(s)' identity are revealed at a later date. As such, and because the author is not a professional nor studying computer science or linguistics, the data provided by this project is not concrete, and the project merely a hobby. If the ghostwriter(s)' identity are revealed before the project's conclusion, the project will terminate. 

# Method
The project will analyze the text in two ways: reading the text and using R stylometry analysis.

# Other information
This is a sister project to analysis of another book published under Hillary's name, Ted Widmer's Hard Choices. The project is located at https://github.com/KnightOfNASA/Hard-Choices.
